# Chkobba

Chkobba is a traditional Tunisian card game with some Italian origins, it is played with a 40-card deck instead of a standard 52-card deck. The objective of the game is to outsmart your opponent by collecting key cards. Read more about it [here](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chkobba).

## Getting Started

The entirety of the project so far is just a few Python files. Any machine that runs Python wouldn't have issues running this game.

## Road Map

* Making chkobba playable on a terminal:
  * Making a player vs player mode.
  * Making a Player vs computer mode.
    * Designing two difficulty levels. (normal and hard)
